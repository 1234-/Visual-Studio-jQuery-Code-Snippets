# Visual Studio jQuery Code Snippets

I have updated the popular jQuery code snippets for use in Visual Studio 2012.

Most of these snippets were originally developed by John Sheehan (http://jquerysnippets.codeplex.com/) for Visual Studio 2010.

Please feel free to submit pull requests to update this project.

## Snippet Listing

There are over 130 code snippets for jQuery included. You can view a listing of all of these snippets on the project wiki here: https://github.com/xxkylexx/Visual-Studio-jQuery-Code-Snippets/wiki/Snippet-Listing

## TODO

- Create an easy installer.
- Update snippets to latest jQuery version. They are currently based on an old jQuery build.
