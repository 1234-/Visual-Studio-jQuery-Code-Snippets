# Visual Studio jQuery Code Snippets

I have updated the popular jQuery code snippets for use in Visual Studio 2012.

Most of these snippets were originally developed by John Sheehan (http://jquerysnippets.codeplex.com/) for Visual Studio 2010.

Please feel free to submit pull requests to update this project.

## Installation

1. Download the "jQuery Snippets" folder and all of its contents from this respository (https://github.com/xxkylexx/Visual-Studio-jQuery-Code-Snippets/zipball/master).
2. Drop the "jQuery Snippets" folder that you just downloaded into the "Documents" > "Visual Studio 2012" > "Code Snippets" folder.
3. In Visual Studio, navigate to "Tools" > "Code Snippet Manager".
4. Select language "HTML" from the language dropdown menu.
5. Select the "Add" button at the bottom.
6. Locate the "Documents/Visual Studio 2012/Code Snippets/jQuery Snippets/jQuery HTML" folder and click "Select Folder".
7. You should now see "jQuery HTML" in the listing of HTML snippets under the Code Snippet Manager.
8. Change the language dropdown at the top of the Code Snippet Manager to "JavaScript".
9. Repeat steps 5-7 for the "Documents/Visual Studio 2012/Code Snippets/jQuery Snippets/jQuery JavaScript" folder.
10. Click "OK" to exit the Code Snippet Manager.
11. Restart Visual Studio.

## TODO

- Create an easy installer.
- Update snippets to latest jQuery version. They are currently based on an old jQuery build.
