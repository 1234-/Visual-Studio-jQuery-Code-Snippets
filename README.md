# Visual Studio jQuery Code Snippets

I have updated the popular jQuery code snippets for use in Visual Studio 2012.

Most of these snippets were originally developed by John Sheehan (http://jquerysnippets.codeplex.com/) for Visual Studio 2010.

## Installation

1. Download all the snippet files from this repository.

2. Drop the HTML and JavaScript snippet folders into My Documents.

3. In Visual Studio, navigate to "Tools" > "Code Snippet Manager".

4. Select language "HTML" from the language dropdown menu.

5. Select the "Add" button at the bottom.

6. Locate your HTML snippets folder that you downloaded and click "Select Folder". All of the HTML snippets should now be added.

7. Change the language dropdown at the top to "JavaScript".

8. Repeat steps 5-7 for the downloaded JavaScript snippets folder.

## TODO

- Create an easy installer.

- Update snippets to latest jQuery version. They are currently based on an old jQuery build.

** Please feel free to submit pull requests to update this project.
